# How was Julia? What aspects of the language did you like/dislike?

I think it was pretty cool to use. You really can see how it is designed to be a programming language for scientific computing, since there are built-in operations that would otherwise be manually set up in another language. For example, you can succinctly solve the system of linear equations `Mx = b` with just `M \ b`.

# Do you think Pluto notebook's interactivity helped you understand the three methods better?

The interactivity definitely helped in visualizing the methods, especially when we parametrize some equations with the slider. It was also fun to play around with the slider and see the effects on the graph it was outputting.

# What were the easiest/hardest parts for you? Were there specific observations you made to make certain parts easier?

The easiest part was actually coding the function. The hardest part was figuring out the math behind it. In that sense, a pen-and-paper solution made the problem more digestible before actually getting to code it.

# Compared to PS 1â€²s Lab problems, do you prefer the format of this Lab problem?

Yes, I do prefer this format. Not only is it (relatively) easier, but you don't have to pull your hair trying to solve some edge cases as you would with a traditional test-cases scoring system. Also, the math is much more noticeable in these Lab problems, which lets you see the whole point of this Numerical Analysis course.
